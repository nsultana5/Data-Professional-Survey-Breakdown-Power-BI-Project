# Data Cleaning in Power BI
The Survey results were exported into Power BI ,  and the data was stored in excel file . Specifically , for the question "Which title best describes your current role, " there were seven predefined options, including one for 'other (please specify)."
## Handling 'Other' Titles
The inclusion of the "other" option led to a diverse range of titles,making analysis and visualization challenging. To address this, the follwoing steps were taken:

1. **Data Separation:**
   -The response marked as "other" were separated from the main dataset.
2. **Splitting Columns:**
 -The 'split column' function in Power BI was employed to break down the "other" responses into distinct titles.
3. **Custom Delimiter:**
   -A custom delimiter was specified during the split operation to effectively categorized and organized the varied titles.
By implementing these steps, the data was prepared for meaningful analysis and visualization, ensuring a clearer representation of the diverse job titles within the survey responses.

This was repeated for the 'What is your favorite programming language' as well specifying colon as the delimiter.

In order to determine the average salary, the data contained a 'Current Yearly Salary' field provided as a range (e.g., 60k â€” 70k). To address this, three duplicate columns were created: the first for the lowest values of the range, the second for the highest value of the range, and the third to calculate the average. This approach enabled a more accurate representation of salary data for subsequent analysis and visualization.
